puts "The Rules of Sudoku:

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. 
The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

The rules of the game are simple: 
1. each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. 
2. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, 
or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, 
must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

Every puzzle has just one correct solution."

puts "How To Play Sudoku!"

"For each turn, enter three integers: one for the block of your choice, 
one for the position in that block, and finally one for the value you would like to input.  
Continue until the board is full and the game is complete!"
